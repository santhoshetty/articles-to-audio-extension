# Phase 1: Backend Foundation

## 1. Set up Supabase Project

- **Create Project:**
  - Sign up for Supabase and create a new project.

- **Database Schema:**
  - **Define tables:**
    - **Articles:** Columns for `id`, `title`, `content`, `summary`, `user_id`, `created_at`, etc.
    - **Audio Files:** Columns for `id`, `article_id`, `file_url`, `user_id`, `created_at`, etc.

- **Storage Buckets:**
  - Create a storage bucket for audio files to manage uploads and retrievals.

## 2. Implement Authentication with Supabase

- **Google OAuth Setup:**
  - Configure Google as an authentication provider in Supabase.
  - Set up redirect URLs and client secrets.

- **User Management:**
  - Use Supabase's built-in authentication methods to handle user sign-ups and logins.
  - Implement session management to keep users logged in.

## 3. Create API Endpoints Using Supabase

- **Auto-generated RESTful API:**
  - Use Supabase's auto-generated API to handle CRUD operations for articles and audio files.

- **Example endpoints:**
  - `POST /articles`: Save a new article.
  - `GET /articles`: Retrieve all articles for a user.
  - `GET /articles/:id`: Retrieve a specific article.
  - `POST /audio`: Upload audio files associated with articles.

## 4. Handle OpenAI API Calls

- **Serverless Functions (if needed):**
  - Create a Supabase Edge Function to handle OpenAI API calls securely.
  - This function will receive requests from the frontend, call the OpenAI API, and return the results without exposing API keys.

## 5. Testing and Validation

- **Test Authentication:**
  - Ensure users can sign up, log in, and manage sessions.

- **Test Database Operations:**
  - Validate that articles can be saved and retrieved correctly.

- **Test Storage:**
  - Ensure audio files can be uploaded and accessed.

# Phase 2: Chrome Extension Update

## 1. Authentication Integration

- **Google OAuth Flow:**
  - Implement the Google OAuth flow in the Chrome extension.
  - Use Supabase's client library to manage authentication.

- **Token Management:**
  - Store the authentication token securely in the extension's storage.

## 2. API Integration

- **Replace Local Storage:**
  - Update the extension to use Supabase's API for saving articles and retrieving data.

- **Update Article Saving Mechanism:**
  - Modify the logic to save articles via the Supabase API instead of local storage.

- **Update Summary/Audio Generation Flow:**
  - Call the serverless function (if implemented) to generate summaries and audio files.

## 3. UI Updates

- **Popup Interface:**
  - Update the popup UI to reflect the new cloud-based storage.
  - Display user account information and sync status.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement user-friendly error messages for API failures.

# Phase 3: Testing & Deployment

## 1. Backend Deployment

- **Deploy Supabase Project:**
  - Ensure the Supabase project is live and accessible.

- **Set Up Monitoring:**
  - Use Supabase's built-in monitoring tools to track API usage and performance.

- **Configure Production Environment:**
  - Ensure all environment variables and settings are configured for production.

## 2. Extension Testing

- **Test Authentication Flow:**
  - Validate that users can log in and out seamlessly.

- **Test Article Saving/Retrieval:**
  - Ensure articles are saved and retrieved correctly from Supabase.

- **Test Summary/Audio Generation:**
  - Validate that summaries and audio files are generated and stored correctly.

- **Test Error Scenarios:**
  - Simulate API failures and ensure the extension handles them gracefully.

## 3. Extension Deployment

- **Package Extension:**
  - Prepare the Chrome extension for deployment.

- **Deploy to Chrome Web Store:**
  - Submit the extension for review and publish it.

# Future Phases

## Mobile App Development

- **Framework Selection:**
  - Choose between React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development.

- **Core Features:**
  - Implement features similar to the Chrome extension, focusing on article viewing and audio playback.

- **Offline Support:**
  - Implement local caching for offline access and sync capabilities.

## Advanced Features

- **User Engagement:**
  - Add features like user profiles, favorites, and sharing options.

- **Analytics:**
  - Implement analytics to track user behavior and engagement.

## Performance Optimizations

- **API Optimization:**
  - Monitor and optimize API performance for low latency.

- **Scalability:**
  - Ensure the architecture can handle increasing user loads.
