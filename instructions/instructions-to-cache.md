To persist user-created or generated data across new windows (for users) and across extension reloads (for developers), the simplest and most reliable approach for a Chrome extension is to use the Chrome Extension Storage API (chrome.storage). In most cases, choosing between chrome.storage.local or chrome.storage.sync depends on whether you want data to sync across the user’s Chrome profiles on different devices (sync) or stay strictly on the local device (local). Either way, chrome.storage is designed to persist data even if the extension is reloaded in developer mode (so long as it is not uninstalled).

Below is a practical strategy to meet all your stated requirements:

---

## 1. Use Chrome’s Extension Storage (Local or Sync) for articles, summaries, titles, API keys

- **chrome.storage.local** is almost always sufficient if you only need to persist data locally for that user’s browser. This is usually preferred for storing potentially larger volumes of data (e.g., article text, generated audio metadata) because it has a higher quota than chrome.storage.sync.

- **chrome.storage.sync** is helpful if you want the user’s data (including API keys) to follow them when they sign in to Chrome on another device. However, sync storage has a lower quota than local storage.

Either way, the usage is similar. For example, using chrome.storage.local:

```js
// Storing data
chrome.storage.local.set({
  articles: savedArticlesArray,
  summaries: savedSummariesArray,
  apiKeys: savedApiKeys
}, () => {
  console.log("Data saved to local storage.");
});

// Retrieving data
chrome.storage.local.get(["articles", "summaries", "apiKeys"], (result) => {
  const articles = result.articles || [];
  const summaries = result.summaries || [];
  const apiKeys = result.apiKeys || {};
  // ...
});
```

You can store all items (article text, generated titles, summaries, and even API keys) under one or more keys in `chrome.storage.local`, and they will remain unless the extension is uninstalled or the user clears browser data specifically for that extension.

## 2. Store audio or large data in IndexedDB (if needed)

If you plan to store actual audio blobs (e.g., large MP3 or WAV data) or potentially large images, consider using IndexedDB in your extension. Chrome’s extension storage has a quota that might be limiting for large media files. IndexedDB can handle much larger amounts of data in a structured way.

Example pattern in a background script or service worker:

```js
// Opening/initializing IndexedDB
function openDb() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = indexedDB.open("MyExtensionDB", 1);
    request.onupgradeneeded = (event) => {
      const db = event.target.result;
      // Create an object store if it doesn’t exist
      if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains("audioFiles")) {
        db.createObjectStore("audioFiles", { keyPath: "id" });
      }
    };
    request.onsuccess = (event) => resolve(event.target.result);
    request.onerror = (event) => reject(event.target.error);
  });
}

// Saving an audio file
async function saveAudioFile(id, audioBlob) {
  const db = await openDb();
  const tx = db.transaction("audioFiles", "readwrite");
  const store = tx.objectStore("audioFiles");
  store.put({ id, audioBlob });
  return tx.complete;
}

// Retrieving an audio file
async function getAudioFile(id) {
  const db = await openDb();
  const tx = db.transaction("audioFiles", "readonly");
  const store = tx.objectStore("audioFiles");
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = store.get(id);
    request.onsuccess = () => resolve(request.result?.audioBlob);
    request.onerror = () => reject(request.error);
  });
}
```

Everything else (like metadata about these files, article text, etc.) still lives comfortably in `chrome.storage.local`.

## 3. Avoid Session Storage or Cookies for persistent data

- **Session Storage** is only kept for the lifetime of that particular window or tab context. Once the user closes the tab or reloads the extension’s page, session storage goes away—this doesn’t fulfill your need to persist data across windows or reloaded sessions.

- **Cookies** are typically for web pages communicating with servers and often come with domain/path restrictions, size limits, and potential security issues if you store sensitive data in them. They are not recommended for your use case.

---

## 4. Outline of the Workflow

1. **User saves an article**  
   - Collect the article content, generated title, summary, and reference to any generated audio or podcast file.  
   - Store them in `chrome.storage.local` under an “articles” key (or multiple keys). If there’s an actual audio file, store it in IndexedDB and keep only its reference (like an ID) in `chrome.storage.local`.

2. **User’s API keys**  
   - Save them in `chrome.storage.local` or `chrome.storage.sync` (depending on whether you want to roam across devices).  
   - On extension initialization (e.g., in `background.js` / service worker), retrieve the keys from storage.

3. **On extension reload (for the developer)**  
   - The extension’s ID is not changing if you’re just reloading it in Developer Mode. All data in `chrome.storage.local` and in IndexedDB remains intact for that extension ID.

4. **On new window**  
   - The user simply opens a new browser window, the background service worker / extension’s data is unchanged. Retrieving data from `chrome.storage.local` or IndexedDB still yields the same stored content.

---

## 5. Tips for Implementation

- Make sure to declare `"storage"` permission in your **manifest.json** if you use chrome.storage:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Newspaper Audio Summarizer",
    "version": "1.0",
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "permissions": ["storage"],
    ...
  }
  ```
- For large data or large user bases, watch out for quotas. Officially, `chrome.storage.local` can store a significant amount of data (usually several MB), while `chrome.storage.sync` is limited to a smaller quota per extension (about 100KB of user data, with some expansions possible).
- If you only store references to audio data (ID or path) in `chrome.storage` but keep the actual binary in IndexedDB, it’s usually enough to avoid hitting storage limits.
- If you’d like to easily manage and sync settings (like API keys or user preferences) across devices, put them in `chrome.storage.sync`, while large, user-generated content (articles, summaries, audio references) remains in `chrome.storage.local`.

### Putting It All Together

**Short answer**: Use `chrome.storage.local` for the bulk of data (articles, summaries, generated podcasts, and references to audio) to keep it simple and persistent across extension reloads and new windows. For actual audio blobs (if large), store them in IndexedDB. If you want user preferences or keys to sync across devices, store them in `chrome.storage.sync`. This approach ensures that neither opening a new window nor reloading the extension in developer mode will cause any data loss.


### Additional Important Point to Workflow

If the article already has any of generated title / summary / audio, then the user should have an option to play the existing audio indicated by a play button, and a re-generate button.
