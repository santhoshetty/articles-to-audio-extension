# Error Handling Implementation

This document summarizes the error handling improvements implemented for the GCP podcast generation function to address the identified issues with the function hanging during audio generation.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Error Classification System

A new error handling utility (`errorHandler.js`) now categorizes errors into specific types:
- Network errors (socket disconnects, connection resets)
- Timeout errors
- API errors
- Rate limit errors
- Memory-related errors

This allows for more precise handling of different error conditions and better diagnosis of recurring issues.

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern

A circuit breaker pattern has been implemented to prevent cascading failures:
- The circuit opens after 5 consecutive failures
- When open, requests fail fast without making API calls
- After a 30-second timeout, the circuit transitions to half-open state
- Successful requests in half-open state restore the circuit to closed state

This prevents the system from continuously hammering failing services or wasting resources on requests that are likely to fail.

### 3. Enhanced Error Context

Errors now include rich context information:
- Correlation IDs (for batch and individual requests)
- Request IDs for API calls
- Detailed context about the operation (voice, text length, etc.)
- Timestamps for easier debugging
- Error type classification

This makes it easier to trace related errors across the system and understand the conditions under which failures occur.

### 4. Hanging Task Detection

A watchdog mechanism for batch processing has been added to detect hanging tasks:
- Monitors tasks in a batch that exceed 1.5x the expected timeout
- Generates detailed diagnostic reports for hanging tasks
- Provides visibility into what was happening when the function hangs

### 5. Improved Retry Logic

The retry logic now features:
- True exponential backoff with a cap at 10 seconds
- More detailed logging during retries
- Circuit breaker checks during retry cycles

### 6. Structured Logging

All logs now include:
- Correlation IDs for easier tracing
- Operation-specific IDs for different stages
- Standardized formats for error reporting
- Consistent prefixing of log messages

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/errorHandler.js` (new) - Core error handling utilities
2. `src/services/audio.js` - Audio processing with enhanced error handling
3. `package.json` - Added uuid dependency for correlation IDs

## Next Steps

After monitoring the impact of these error handling improvements, the following recommendations should be considered:

1. Memory Optimization:
   - Optimize buffer handling to release memory more aggressively
   - Implement incremental storage to cloud storage

2. Network Resilience:
   - Further tune exponential backoff parameters
   - Add more sophisticated retry logic

3. Monitoring Improvements:
   - Enhance watchdog capabilities
   - Add performance metrics collection

4. Batch Strategy Revision:
   - Consider reducing batch size from 5 to a smaller number
   - Implement better pacing between batches

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the effectiveness of these changes:
1. Test with intentionally failing API calls to verify circuit breaker behavior
2. Monitor correlation IDs in logs to ensure they flow properly through the system
3. Measure memory usage with the new error handling to ensure no additional overhead
4. Test recovery from network failures to verify improved resilience
